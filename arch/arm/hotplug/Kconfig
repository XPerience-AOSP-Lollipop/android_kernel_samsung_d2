config ZEN_DECISION
	bool "Zen Decision MPDecision Replacement"
	depends on SMP && FB
	default y
	help
	  MPDecision is a userspace service that does several functions
	  related to CPU Frequency and CPU Hotplugging. Some of these are:
	  - Remove cores when screen goes off
	  - Enable cores when screen goes on
	  - Raise CPU_MIN_FREQ to a fixed value for a few seconds on input
  
	  Zen Decision allows some of the MPDecison functions to be delegated
	  to the kernel. Right now these are
	  - Remove cores when screen goes off (after a configurable amount of time)
	  - Enable cores when screen comes on (immediately)

	  Zen Decision assumes the input boost function of MPDecision should be
	  delegated to somewhere else in the kernel (Such as in CPU-BOOST)

	  Enable this if you'd like the ability to disable MPDecision.
